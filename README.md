## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### My name is Reina and I'm a GIT UX Design major :joy:
Iâ€™m currently in school part-time while working remotely for a design agency in Hawaii. I graduated with AS in Interface Design back in 2014 when UX was still a bit at its infancy. I learned my coding fundamentals from interface programming classes when I took my AS degree in Hawaii. Everything else, I learned as a front-end web developer at my workplace. I joined the military in 2015 so that I can receive the education benefit to go back to school. After getting out in 2021, I finally gained the courage to go back to college in hopes to get my Bachelors degree in UX and move up my career ladder.
